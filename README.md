## Project 2 - Wines Classification

Working on a clean dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009), I will build several models in order to classify wines as good and bad ones.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Building several different models using scaling and PCA to get best resultats
3. Using Eli library for interpretation
